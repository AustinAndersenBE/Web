1. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It sets rules for transferring files on the web. It states how the clients and servers should respond
to certain commands.

2. URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and it is an address for something like a web page.

3. DNS stands for Domain Name System. It converts the human readable - URL into IP addresses so that computers can identify each other. 

4. A query string is the part of the URL where you pass key-value pairs into the URL. like ?name=Spring&year=2023

5. GET- gets data from the server (it does not change anything)
POST - sends data to the server (this changes data on the server)

6. An HTTP request is when a client such as a browser sends a message to a web server to do an action following the HTTP protocol

7. An HTTP response would then be a response from the web server to the browser that follows the HTTP protocol

8. HTTP header is a key-value pair that is in a HTTP request or response that gives more information about the request or responce.
Examples of request headers could be User-Agent, Accept, Host, Authorization
Examples of response headers could be Content-Type, Cache-Control, Set-Cookie,Location

9. DNS Lookup happens and the browser resolves the name into an IP address
The browser then establishes a connection to the IP address and then sends various metadata in the form of headers such as type of browser, or any stored cookies ,etc
The server will then reply to the browser's request by providing the HTML content. Status code 200 means it was successful.
The browser then creates the DOM from the HTML and it identifies additional elements like images, CSS, JavaScript, etc
Then for each of the additional resources, the browser issues separate HTTP requests and incorporates the responses (images, css, files) into the final webpage.

I then, used the hosted the simple movies app webpage using python3 -m http.server
First, I went to the directory to where my files are stored. Then I ran python3 -m http.server and it says Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
Then I went to http://localhost:8000 and I saw my webpage displayed there. Then I Ctrl+C to stop the server on the terminal.
